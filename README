FOOTBALL PLAYER DATABASE
    The football player database is hosted on Google spreadsheets and is loaded
    into the application while in development. The data will be downloaded and
    included within the final production build.

URLs
    The client side URL's are part of the guardina.com domain and use hash
    fragments for routing.

    The base folder will act as the default route and will display the primary
    team edit view.

    A player's current team can be views on the 'match' route when their ID is
    specified.

    A match takes place between two players when two valid IDs are provided.

    /                           - Team construction and edit page
    /#match/:userID             - Player's team view
    /#match/:userID/:userID2    - Match view between two players
    /#result/:matchID           - (preliminary) past match result

    Creation and updating of a user's team is handles by the data-store
    server. The server is a REST based API to a Mongo DB.

    http://ec2-54-195-231-244.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/
   
    The server accepts the following end-points:

    GET  /allusers          - DEBUG: Get all registered users
    GET  /users/?guardianID - Get user data by ID
    GET  /users/:userid     - Get user data by 
    POST /users/:userid     - Create user
    PUT  /users/:userid     - Update user data


USER DATASTORE
    User's teams are stored in a Mongo database hosted on an Amazon EC2
    instance.

    InstanceID: i-b701e6f4 (interactive:world-cup dream dream datastore)
    URL:        ec2-54-195-231-244.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com


    As part of the database set-up, ensure the user's Guardian ID is unique.

    db.users.ensureIndex( { 'guardianID': 1 }, { unique: true });
